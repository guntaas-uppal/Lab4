# Project Overview
After working with a basic HTML structure that included headers, footers, main content areas, news items, etc., we wrote CSS code to create a responsive webpage design. In our web development process, responsive design was a key factor that made sure web content looks great but also works on desktops, tablet, and smartphones.
